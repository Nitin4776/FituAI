## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Forest green (#34A04A) to evoke a sense of health, nature, and growth. This is not teal.
- Background color: Light beige (#F5F5DC), providing a neutral and calming backdrop that ensures readability and highlights the other colors.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080), an analogous color to green. Used sparingly for interactive elements like buttons and progress bars to draw attention and add a touch of sophistication.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif to promote readability of all text. Headline font: 'Playfair', a modern sans-serif with a fashionable, high-end feel.
- Clean and modern icons, with the green primary color as the main color, with a more saturated version as highlight on hover.
- A clean and user-friendly layout is required. Plenty of whitespace, intuitive navigation, and clear hierarchy are needed to deliver an app that does not feel cluttered.
